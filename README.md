# SCGen: A Versatile Generator Framework for Agile Design of Stochastic Circuits

## Requirements

- OpenCV
- GiNaC
- Ninja
- Other essential building tools (g++, cmake, etc)


## Building

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cd build
ninja
```

## File structure

- `Benchmarks` includes some test circuits to evaluate the performance of SCGen
- `Circuits_API` stores the cirucits used to evaluate the DSE acceleration methods. Circuits designed by users are also stored here. An example is in `Circuits_API/circuit_api_example.cpp`.
- `include` stores the source code of SCGen.
- `Verilog` stores some commonly used modules in the `Verilog/Modules` folder. The generated Verilog code will also go here. Note: in order to use the Verilog code generated by some circuits, users should copy some commonly used modules in `Verilog/Modules` to the generated folder.
